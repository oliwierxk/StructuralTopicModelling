And they have no idea of how is the other floor doing, so when we got there it was super crowded and you could barely walk/move. The staff was incredibly rude and we were ignored not only before, but also while trying to talk to the guy behind the counter. He gave us short and rude answer with barely looking at us.

After our next request for the ordered beer, the waitress disappeared into the pub for another 5 minutes. So I went inside, where it turned out that our order was not in the system.

Hence . A few months later I'm there with my wife! (We did walk for ages... up and down streets that look similar... until we found this gem!)
Service was fast. We sat outside with our complimentary blankets... and soon had two 500ml local beers.
My wife chose a cheese potato with red beans... American style cheese sauce with kidney beans.  I chose the Mackerel/Herring with cream sauce. (Think roll mop Herring).  It was all very nice.. although mine.. there was a lot of vinegar and fish.. more than perhaps you would need!
However... very very tasty and traditional.

I said hello and explained that we had a reservation, in Polish.
I had made the reservation mostly in Polish, too.
But I am not that confident to translate a whole menu for my wife. 
If it was just me, I would maybe just chance it with the Polish menu, but my wife needs reassurance that she understands what she is  ordering. So, I asked for menus in English and the atmosphere changed.
The food took ages to arrive and when it did, the chips were cold, as if they had been left standing.
Drinks did not turn up.
I spoke to the waiter several times on the way past to attract his attention but he ""did not hear me"".
Eventually, I went to the counter and asked about the drinks. Grudgingly, he brought them over. I am not sure if one of the beers was one that another table had already sent back for being wrong. I saw a member of staff taste it.
Cold chips (French fries). 
Nobody bothered to ask if everything was OK. By this time, we had decided to just power through and get out of there.
Same problem as before trying to get attention of the waiter to ask for the bill. It is not a big restaurant. It would be impossible for waiter not to hear me on the way past.
So, I went to the counter again. At thix point they asked iv everything had been OK. I said no, the chips were cold. No response. 
Paid the bill and escaped.

After entering the place, it turned out that it was quite crowded and, according to the principle ""if there are a lot of people, it must be good"", we decided to stay.

A bit of a strange situation considering that it was 15/16. As the May weekend was quite cold this year, we wanted a warming soup. As the menu says, ask the waitress about the soup of the day. The answer totally blew us away: cold soup! There are no others to choose from. We accepted it and decided to order tea, mulled wine, stuffed potato and Gypsy potato pancake. After the waitress reminded us, we waited 25 minutes for tea, 40 minutes for mulled wine, and about 60 minutes for main courses. The dishes themselves were very average, but the portions were large.

I asked why, the waiter said that the potatoes already was prepared in the kitchen, so they could not change it.. So silly, everyone knows you don't have 40 different potatoes already done in the kitchen. The restaurant wasn't even fully booked..... I didn't have any potato this day, and if i ever go back to Gdansk i will  not come back to this restaurant.

1,"Rarely have I found myself faced with such regrettable treatment by staff who work in front of the public. I relate the facts:
We are a couple sightseeing in Gdansk and we went into this place to eat (around 2 in the afternoon). We asked for a table for two, they reluctantly showed us a table and there we sat, waiting for them to bring us the menu cards. After a few minutes, other diners arrive and sit at a table next to us and bring them the menu cards instantly. Other diners come, and the same thing. Since they don't bring it to us, I call the waitress to ask for them and she doesn't pay any attention to us. Since we were already there for about 15-20 minutes without them paying attention to us, we got up and left.
I can't rate the food because I didn't try it, but I can say that the treatment received at this place was deplorable. I still don't understand the reason for this treatment and how you can have that type of unprofessional staff working.

And this is where the problems started. After 10 minutes of waiting, they started loading drinks on the tables taken after us, and there was silence. After the warning, the waitress disappeared somewhere in the back and reappeared only after another 15 minutes, both dishes and drinks. Trout. Two thin fillets with a completely light breading color and completely unseasoned. Zero taste. In fact, the only thing that added flavor was the damn artificial garlic sauce. That's nothing yet. Even though the potato was warm inside, the cheese didn't melt or anything. Even though it was described on the menu as ""gorgonzola"", it didn't even resemble it. But there was 3 times too much of the cheapest something resembling cheese. Plus bacon, raw, thrown into the dish just to heat it up. Massacre. The potato itself was very good, but the excess of this ""cheese"" killed everything, even the appetite.

3,"We went there based on the TripAdvisor rating and the location. The location is very good and the prices, considering such a good location, are very competitive.

When it comes to the taste of the dishes, we have no major reservations, except that the dish becomes too monotonous towards the end.

However, in the case of service, we were disappointed. The waitresses often made mistakes (and not only at our table). Every now and then they were running around explaining that someone had made a mistake with the sauce or that a key ingredient was missing in the ordered dish. In our case, when we ordered kvass, which according to the card was supposed to be 0.5L, we received 0.3L. Only when we asked why it was different from the one we ordered, the waitress explained that they did not have 0.5L kvass and only sold 0.3L.

4,"Delicious baked potatoes with stuffing! We haven't eaten such good ones anywhere! However, the waiting time for food and the level of service lowered our rating. The waitress forgot some of our orders three times, she was wrong. Moreover, I believe that the staff should manage the queue and seats, and not leave it to the guests because it would end in quarrels - during our visit, there were as many as 3 such situations, to which the waitresses threw up their hands and told them to ""resolve the matter among themselves"". Not very professional. The kvass wasn't as good as the kvass, the rest was ok.

2,"We ordered two fish sets, but unfortunately instead of trout, my companion received flounder, and the waiter insisted that it was trout. Everything was eaten, because how can we argue when ""trout is always served with onion"" (we disproved this thesis after eating it by checking the menu again that the waiter was wrong). I understand that he may have just been learning, but the mistake must have occurred when placing the order and another person picked it up. After 10 minutes of waiting, a third person brought the bill. The restaurant agreed to a 10% discount (we had to suggest it ourselves), which I consider a plus, but the service was not the best that day, and it's not just about the situation with the exchange of dishes. The bill was brought 10 min. after request. I also saw that guests from England, after asking for an English-language menu, were ignored and had to guess what to order. As for the taste, finally - the fish is amazing, a bit too much oil on the plate, but it's ok. The fries were ok, one salad was good, the other was bland. Bad idea adding onion to flounder. Peas with cod - an interesting combination. I was in Gdańsk for a few days, I'm going to come back to this city, but definitely not to this bar.

3,"Restaurant No. 1 according to Trip Advisor, so a great choice for an anniversary trip with my wife. But is it really? The atmosphere of the place is pleasant, American style, with a beautiful view from the granary island. Unlimited quantities of popcorn for an appetizer - cool. First course - appetizer, Chorizo ​​soup. Very tasty, with character, definitely too sweet to drink, a non-alcoholic drink, my wife took watermelon lemonade and that's the first failure, rude, super sweet syrup, it wasn't even next to the watermelon, I wonder if they also make lemonade from some lemon syrup, especially at this price. We took the iconic sets, my wife had classic ribs with pineapple, everything was beautiful in the photo but in reality she verified it, not much glaze, the ribs were soft and nicely falling off the bones, the salad was the most ordinary in the world and the potato was tasteless, if it weren't for the cottage cheese it would have been terrible, aaaand I would have forgotten , the grilled pineapple was from a can, in the middle of the season when you can get fresh pineapples in a dish for PLN 80, we have a small slice canned pineapple. My burger was okay, the meat was ground too fine in my opinion, and the bun was great, there was no sesame, the fries were very good. For dessert, Mars in cake, Mars itself is super sweet, plain cake, very good vanilla ice cream, nasty cream that tastes like those from spray cans. Plus for the idea and courage for Mars. For an average eater, such cuisine may be tasty because it is fatty and overly sweet, but for more demanding customers it is definitely not. The service deserves a lot of praise, Ms. Olga was very professional, nice, sincere and friendly, she approached us several times and asked how we liked it, after the starter she asked if we could serve main courses, which was very nice, she gave us good advice and finally accepted from us all feedback and promised to share our opinion to improve the quality. I hope that the quality will improve because the position in the ranking is obligatory and for me this visit should place this restaurant below the top ten.

5,"Was quickly received by the wonderful waitress Olivia who quickly fixed a table for us at the outdoor terrace. 
The weather was not at its best, but she arranged a table for us next to a small ""fireplace"" where it quickly became warm and comfortable. 
We ordered Billy's own bottled beer, there were three varieties to choose from and the choice fell on the IPA. 
It was probably one of the best beers we drank in Poland. A bowl of popcorn quickly arrived and Olivia took our order. 
When we were there for lunch, we decided to each have an American salad, it is very similar to Caesar salad but without bacon. 
After about 10 minutes, a wonderful salad arrived, we chose to skip the two baguettes that were included, the salad was magically good and the chicken very well cooked. 
We ate in peace and when we had to pay, the bill came quickly.

1,"Very dissatisfied. Absolutely nothing special. Mediocre burgers, boring hard and unsalted fries. Ordered a burger with bluecheese but there was no bluecheese flavor at all. It was so tasteless, unsalted and so boring. Well fried and quite juicy though. But how difficult can it be, maybe some spices or a quality cheese that tastes something? The barbecue sauce as a side dish in a cup was the only thing that tasted of anything, guess it wasn't their own. No response at all other than a shrug when I complained that my burger didn't taste like anything. If you don't care about feedback that you give directly on the spot to the staff, then you can write here. Absolutely the only and last time for us!",Not worth the money.

5,"Let me start by saying that my wife hates cheese. None. And even more so the mold that was in the burger. 
We were served by a waitress named Natalia. Already at the beginning of the conversation I knew that we had come to the right place with both the place and the service. As I mentioned, my wife hates cheese. Mrs. Natalia, even though she knew about it, offered her wife a burger with blue cheese, although it was supposed to be something with chicken. Since I can eat anything, we decided to take the risk and as my wife said: ""I have never eaten a better burger..."".
I was unsure between the ribs and the burger. Without hesitation, Mrs. Natalia's answer was ribs and I was not disappointed!! Championship! 
On the second day, encouraged by the delicious food and service, we returned. I took the Rokefeler burger (delicious!) and my wife took the chicken (it was ok.)
Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired.
To sum up. If we come to Gdańsk again, we will definitely visit this place! 
Ms. Natalia's service, even though the sign said ""I'm learning"", deserves praise. I have been working in the catering industry for 15 years and it is really rare to meet people with such an approach. Casual but professional. Polish gastronomy needs such people :)

However, the operation was more than incompetent. 
We ordered our food and had extra information if my wife had a cow's milk allergy and the steak had to be fried without butter and the salad should only have vinegar and oil as a dressing. Of course this didn't work. It couldn't have been the language because our friend spoke perfect Polish and told the waitress again. 
After we complained that the meat was served with butter, a new inedible piece of meat came back and forth. The manager just said it was ribey and it was normal for this meat to be tough. 
It was completely calculated.

The meals are all impressive visually and well presented ,freshly cooked and tasty. The kitchen pass is visible from the tables.
The drinks are equally as impressive ,my partners drink was spectacular creating smoke (some sort of vapour!) from the glass . In the restaurant they have a popcorn maker and this adds the aroma of caramelised sugar.
All the dishes look great ,my choice was a burger which was very filling .We also chose dessert which again did not disappoint (warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream).

The restaurant is decorated like an old American style diner and is very authentic looking, quirky red leather booths and checked table cloths. Ordered drinks. Aperol Spritz for me and beer for Mr H. The Aperol Spritz comes out fizzing which is very cool! Chicken tenders to start to share which were ok.. but I didn’t eat many as I thought they were slightly on the under done side but they were ok. That is I’m afraid where the positives ended, Mr H got steak and baked potato, the steak was poor and the baked potatoes looked like they’d been sitting out for days and then given a quick grill. My salad was very basic and the halloumi in it also felt like it had seen better days. Mr H was still hungry as he hadn’t ate much of the steak and potatoes so ordered the deep fried Mars bar… but again it came out warm and seemed to have been sitting and reheated… the food was just not great! The staff however are lovely and very attentive and this is why it gets 3 stars.

A big thank you to all Eliksir employees, because both in the planning phase and during the event, they did everything to make us happy with the results. Mrs. Ewa, event manager, advised us on every issue in the last (and most nerve-wracking :)) weeks, always stayed in touch with us, and approached the bride and groom's proposals very freely. Jakub the manager, you couldn't dream of a better wedding guardian, with his professionalism and individual approach he made a great impression on every guest. Applause also for the bartenders and waiters, because all orders were handled very efficiently, and there were a lot of us for such a place.
We were delighted with the food, the set menu formula is not for everyone, but if someone wants a wedding with original, high-quality food, they will not be disappointed. The same applies to the cocktails and alcohol served. Many of our guests had the opportunity to try something new, and they certainly did not complain about the portion size :)

5,"After being recommended Eliksir, we chose to visit the restaurant when we were in Gdansk. From the menu we found ""Tasting menu"" with ""Cocktail pairing"". Appetizers, main courses and desserts ended with 3 confectionary chocolates in beautiful packaging. For 3 hours we tasted the most wonderful dishes with customized drinks. 
A fun surprise was that sorbet was prepared with liquid nitrogen at our table.

1,"November in Gdansk can be cold. Sitting on a old tram without heating for more than 20 minutes to get from the city to this restaurant is not fun, but one must sacrifice something for the sake if a good meal. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before my 8pm reservation. The staff seemed somewhat puzzled by me appearing, as the restaurant was fully booked for some kind of happening. The head waiter (or whatever he was) came over, and after consulting his laptop he was able to confirm that I indeed had a reservation. Much to his surprise. Not that it helped, because they were full. So, I am currently in another cold tram returning to the city centre. And I am still hungry. He did seem genuinely sorry  and he tried offering me a table another night, but I am leaving. He offered me a bottle of champagne,  but as I have amply demonstrates in the past I have no problems in buying copious quantitites of alcolhol without any assistance. If I wanted to spend the night chugging champagne in my room all by my lonesome I could have saved myself the one hour round trip. The food may be delicioys  I have no idea. What is certain is that they have poor organizing skills. Do not trust the online reservation they offer through Open Table.

2,"We unfortunately had a very bad experience at Eliksir, we tried hard to like it but there were just too many things that were very disappointing.
We had pre-ordered the 7 dishes tasting menu with cocktail pairing and had asked for a change of one dish, they mentioned when doing this that the charge would be an extra 25 zł or person, which was fine, the menu on the website show the following ‘Every change in tasting menu must be agreed with the staff and it is extra 25 zł per each.’ However when we paid it turned out that the change cost 25 zł plus the price of the dish we changed too, this would have been fine had it been mentioned anywhere beforehand but like this it was an unfortunate surprise at the end of a bad evening.
Although the whole menu had been pre-ordered, the waiting game now began. We arrived at 7.30 pm and didn’t leave until 0.30 am. 5 hours for 7 dishes and 2 small dishes, is just way way too long.
The food was not bad, but only a few dishes were actually good, the rest were bland and lacking different textures, a lot of the dishes were just soft elements.
The cocktail pairing they very obviously ran out of the right glasses, a lot of the cocktails were red and served in the same glasses again and again it turns into a repetitive experience of red cocktails.
The wait between dishes took a lot out of the mood, the last two dishes we waited 1 hour for each, we mentioned the wait before the dessert and were told the kitchen would be ready when they were ready and that there was nothing the waiter could do, after this we preceded to wait for 1 hour for the dessert.
The palette cleanser we got before the dessert, was a blurb of ‘sorbet’ placed in a tea candle holder, not in anyway presented nicely.
All in all this was very dissatisfactory, disappointing and too expensive for the service we received.",A very long and disappointing night,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen,MathildeH104,2021-11-28,,,,,,,neg,2021.0,Foreigner
1,"Booked this restaurant for my friends 50th birthday.  I flew from Uk to Cork and then, my friends and I flew from Cork to Gdansk fro 4 days. 
I booked the restaurant for 7pm sitting.  Prior to leaving the UK. We travelled by taxi which took 45 mins from Gdansk old town rush hour. We were greeted by friendly staff. The restaurant  was empty with only 2 other tables having guests.  
We stat down and immediately our waiting staff came to us to say that there was nothing available from the grill menu due to sustainability meaning no chicken or beef dishes or anything from the main course grill section. That they only order a certain amount in.
I said we should of been contacted before arriving with this information and we were told they couldn't ring all customers. The restaurant is not that large and only 2 other tables had guests that evening. 
We were offered a small taster venue which had nothing on it that any of us would eat. This was so deveststing to here given the occasion. The staff then came back and said they may have 1 chicken. We said what do the other 2 eat? 
When we asked for the manager, he said he had 1 piece of beef belonging to the next day order that they could cut into 3.
I mean we were blown away by this from a michellin star restaurant.
He then proceeded to recommend another restaurant locally but at that point we decided to go back to Old Town Gdansk to try and make the evening special for my friends birthday. 
So by 7pm at a restaurant that is highly rated to have only taster menus available is shocking.
We were then left with 2 sizeable taxi fares.
Thankfully we got lucky at Chleb I Wino Gdansk who saved the day. 
We were given a zero alcohol bottle of something obviously no use to us given we were flying to Ireland the next day.",Check the menu is available before travelling. Shocking 7pm booking,"Cork, Ireland",Cork,gilliano913,2024-08-16,,,,,,,neg,2024.0,Foreigner

2,"I booked here for a romantic dinner with my girlfriend. Sadly it seems they had a very bad night.
The vaitors seemed very kind, showed us out table and gave us the menu.
We decided to go with the tasting menu and cocktail pairing.
The vaitor then told us that 7pm was too late for the tasting menu.
We then decided to go with the a la carte.
The starters arrived, and the vaitor forgot the white wine I ordered. And didn't realize it until it was done.
We ordered some bread, and asked to have another look at the wine menu.
We ordered the wine, and waited once again.
Our main dishes arrived, still no bread, and still waiting for the wine.
When I separated my stead it was overcooked and far from medium as ordered.
It took a few minutes before I got in contact with the vaitor, and since my girlfriend had to start eating her dish, and we wouldn't be able to enjoy dinner together anyway, I chose to just pay and leave.
I sincerely hope it was just a really bad night for them, but our dinner date was ruined.

5,"Eliksir has long been on my culinary list of places to visit. I had the pleasure of trying chef Paweł Wątor's dishes a few years ago at one of the events. First of all, a place with a large selection of original cocktails and various types of drinks could only be a plus. What impressed me was the atmosphere, freedom and enthusiastic waiter service, especially thanks to Mrs. Marta and the rest of the team (sorry, I don't remember their names). We started the dishes with a delicious Martini cocktail, a good choice made us want more and more of such delicacies. In short, sturgeon tartare, Złotnicki bacon and Kashubian dessert will remain in our memory for a long time. There is a lot of emphasis on product quality. I HIGHLY encourage everyone to visit Eliksir. After my experience in Scotland with star restaurants, I would like Michelin inspectors to notice Pomerania, because there are many places here that deserve attention. It was a pleasure for us to try Chef Wątor's dishes. Well done to the team.

4,"The starting point for Eleksir is very good, but unfortunately it falls a little short on the details. 
We love the concept and had high expectations for the experience. 
Unfortunately, Elixir doesn't reach all the way up. 
The menu looks very exciting on paper. We chose 7 dishes with accompanying cocktail pairings. 
The menu is very extensive and we struggle at times to distinguish between the size of what is a starter and a main course. We miss a greater balance and variety in the dishes in the menu, overall the dish had far too many dominant flavours. This means that you don't get as many opportunities to let your taste buds relax during the meal. The whole experience therefore becomes very overwhelming. 
The service was as expected, a bit slow service at times. We had to wait a while from the time we sat down until we got something good in the glass. 
We are of the opinion that there was a bit too much light on in the premises during our visit, it is one of the details which means that you do not get top results with us.","So close, but yet so fare away","Froland Municipality, Norway",Froland Municipality,thomashansen2015,2022-11-28,,,,,,,pos,2022.0,Foreigner

Each subsequent visit to Eliksir is a bull's-eye. My fiancé and I visit Eliksir regularly and we never leave with any ""buts"". 
During our last visit, we tried the tasting menu with matching drinks. 
The current menu is a very successful modern interpretation of Polish cuisine. Delicate steak tartare without the slightest vein or piece of fat, sturgeon pate, light sour soup with pickled celery broth, bacon roast, rainbow trout fried without fat and a wonderful dessert - all this is a real feast for the senses, and especially for the palate. 
The service was well trained and polite, our waiter described the process of preparing each dish in a very interesting way and did not just list the ingredients. 
Eliksir W Bottle bartender syrups deserve additional attention - I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to prepare a good drink at home without much effort. My favorites are Basil Smash and Lime Sour. Of course, we stocked up before leaving.

3,"I was soooo disappointed with the visit there as I was expecting something extraordinary and I was sooo looking forward to the visit. 
Me and my partner both ordered the vegetarian tasting menu with a selection of coctails - in the alcoholic and non-alcoholic version. 
First of all - kudos for having a vegetarian tasting menu. I really appreciate restaurants offering such options. 
Food: Unfortunately I am sad to admit that the food was... well, it was not ""bad"" but it was not good either. Nothing special, bland, the flavours in the dishes were not surprising, dishes lacked texture or even had an unpleasant texture (like the appetizer with asparagus which was weirdly slime'y in texture, or the ruby chocolate in the dessert which was gluey). The best part of the food is that, i have to admit, the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The asparagus, carrots, potatoes, really perfect texture. 
Coctails and pairing: 
Some of them were really delicious, some I didn't like at all but that's probably personal taste so that would have been fine. The issue I have is that the coctails did nothing to the food and vice versa. From the restaurant that specializes in pairing I expected more ""connection"" between the food and the drinks, like it can happen with food and wine. Second issue was that it turned out that the non-alcoholic coctails were actually made in the exact same way as the regular ones, just without alcohol. On one hand this is good - for the person not drinking % it gives the closest experience. On the other hand, without the alcohol addition the majority of virgin coctails were simply unbalanced and too sweet. 
Experience: the staff waiting on us was nice, but they all seemed a bit nervous all the time which at times created awkward atmosphere. It was correct, nothing bad happened, but also just doesn't convince me to go back there.","sadly, nothing special","Gdansk, Poland",Gdansk,majablanka,2022-07-04,,,,,,,pos,2022.0,Poland
5,"For a long time, I heard good opinions about the place. Finally, I had a chance to go with a group of friends.
Cuisine ranges on the higher end of prices, but with the offered ingredients, it is reasonable.
For the dishes - we have ordered a tasting menu, one of which was vegetarian. Every person at our table was pleased.
The starters were almost perfect. Each was enjoyable the only caveat was that I did not get any taste from the first bite-sized piece. (Drink earlier might have killed it, but it was not a proposed cocktail pairing)
As for the main course - the first dish was exquisite. The second one was 'just' good.
The dessert - I did not eat a goat cheese for a dessert up to this point, but that panna cotta was fabulous, sorbet on the side was dreamy too.
Drinks. We ordered a variety of drinks I enjoyed each one. Deluxe options seem a bit overpriced.
The service was perfect. Our waitress explained each dish and cocktail. If we had any questions about the menu or place we were given a good, concise explanation. She was also exuding positive vibes, which only adds to the overall experience.",Great fine dining,"Gdansk, Poland",Gdansk,Siebio,2022-06-18,,,,,,,pos,2022.0,Poland

I prepared some of my favorite cocktails: Naked & Famous, Negroni (with a creative twist) as well as Whiskey Sour as the New York Sour version. Not only were the cocktails great but also the course made me feel like a true bartender for a bit! The vibes during the workshop were awesome and I had a lot of fun with Mark and the rest of the Eliksir team - to the extent that my wife and I stayed over for a couple of hours after the course just ordering drinks and enjoying ourselves.

But later we had the deer dish who was about the best slice of meat i ever tasted, the sauce was a perfect combo.
The rest of the dishes was just OK after that, and yeah the Coctails witch tasted in a wierd way like the dish it was served amongst, but none of them was likable, maybe the one who came in a copper mug.

On arriving at 7.30pm we were early for our table but they took us without any problems as not busy being out of season and on a Tuesday.  Lovely  decor however it was a bit cold in the restaurant.  We decided on the 7 course tasting menu with cocktail pairing.  When the waiter came to take our order, we were told could not have the 7 course only the 5 course as it was too late in the evening.  This was a real problem as the 5 course menu had lamb which neither of us really eat.  I questioned why this was not mentioned at time of booking that we may not have the 7 course menu as we would have went elsewhere.  Never had this issue before at any other restaurants  we have been to.  We decided to go ahead with the 5 course menu and I changed my lamb course for pork.  Apart from the soup dish everything else was delicious, my partner had the lamb and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was.  The only other issue was we asked for water for table but never got it.  Cocktails were nice and change from the normal wine flights.  We would return but would like to try the 7 course menu.

3,"A simple family pizzeria with a very small but cozy dining area inside. When the weather is good, it is more pleasant to sit on the terrace. 
We were guided by the very good reviews on Tripadvisor and by the price indication of € 1, and that set our expectations at a high level.
We ordered a vegetarian pizza and a meat calzone pizza.
Both pizzas were very tasty and tasty. The prices in 2023 will no longer be as cheap as the photos (from 2016) of the menu on Tripadvisor make it out. My pizza calzone cost 42 złoty.  It has become considerably more expensive in just a few years. Price-quality is still very good compared to Western European prices. 
The diverse choice of Polish beers are correctly priced. A downside was the red house wine, which disappointed on all levels.  So not recommended. Slightly dull taste, like too much water in wine.
Total bill was 115 złoty for two pizzas, a glass of house wine and a 0.5 L beer
. And despite the price increases over the years, that remains a very fair and pleasant experience.",Charming simple pizzeria for a fair price,"Antwerp, Belgium",Antwerp,Kristof_L_A,2023-08-07,,,,,,,pos,2023.0,Foreigner

4,"My wife and I were in Gdańsk for 4 nights and one evening we had the hunger for a pizza. We used trip advisor to search for recommended pizza in Gdańsk and tried to go to a couple of restaurants that were rated no1 and no2 but they were fully booked. We tried La Famiglia which was no3 at the time, it was a bit hard to find but google maps managed to get us there. 
Upon entering we felt like it was a takeaway similar to that which you would find in the uk but there were a few tables in the restaurant with condiments on them. We asked if it was going okay to take a seat to which the waitress politely replied. We took our seats and ordered shortly after - not an extensive range of pizzas but enough to pick something that we fancied. Beer wise there was a choice of local beers from Browar Amber ranging from dark to APA. On the whole it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely return for a delicious taste of their pizza and another cheeky beer or two.",Delicious cheap pizza,"Arbroath, United Kingdom",Arbroath,SmokieMo,2020-02-16,,,,,,,pos,2020.0,Foreigner

The pizzas are thin and crispy based. I had the vegetarian (there’s a couple suitable for non meat eaters), Dining Companion had capricciosa. Both well done, decently topped with plenty of stuff.

One drawback - when the delivery guys were coming in and out, they left the door open and we were cold. Someone needed to stand up to go and close the door. This should not happen.

5,"Pizzeria La Famiglia is a recently opened place in the Old Town of Gdańsk. They advertise themselves as a place serving real Italian pizza. I decided to check.
Thin dough, perfectly baked and crispy. Spread with a sauce based on natural tomatoes, which are noticeable in it. The dough is not soggy from the sauce. Cheese was placed on top of the sauce and then melted. The prepared pancake only contained Parma ham and arugula, as well as unmelted pieces of Parmesan cheese.  
The pizza is not large, but it is delicious. The dough is perfect, the Parma ham is real. Olive oil is served with the pizza. The only thing we can complain about is too little tomato sauce on the pancake (it was not evenly distributed), but this is a minor thing that can be compensated relatively easily. The undoubted advantage of this place are the prices. Pizza Di Parma does not differ in quality and taste from its competitor counterparts, and it is much cheaper. The disadvantage of the place is that it is very small and the lack of air conditioning makes it hot (the pizza oven is close to the tables).

3,"While sightseeing in Gdańsk, we went to La Famiglia pizzeria. The first thing we noticed was the tiny interior of the place and a tiny menu with only a few items. (the menu includes soup of the day, probably 8 types of pizza, 2 salads, dessert of the day and that's it). Because it wasn't a warm day, we couldn't use the summer garden at the pizzeria. The waitress, in response to our questions, informed us that there was no dessert of the day at all, but the soup of the day was carrot cream (for which the accompanying person thanked us). So we ordered two pizzas: the classic Capriciosa and Di Parma. We also ordered a latte and tea with lemon. The pizzas appeared on the table quite quickly. I would rate their size as something between a small and medium pizza. The cake was so thin that after eating it and still feeling hungry, we decided to order another one. The choice fell on Formaggio. Comparing all three pizzas, we found that Capriciosa was the tastiest. We liked Formaggio the least - it was fatty and we didn't notice the presence of four types of cheese. A tiny cube of gorgonzola was only on one slice of pizza. The decor of the place and its small size were probably supposed to be associated with a small Italian pizzeria, but for me it was bland. In my opinion, the place is more like a pizza bar than a restaurant (enter, eat and leave), which would be more suitable by the sea, not in the city center. The service did not make any impression - neither good nor bad. The pizzas were served on wooden boards without cutlery, napkins or olive oil. While looking around the pizzeria, we noticed that the above items were on a small table against the wall. However, the waitress did not inform about this fact. Cutlery available only in plastic version. The price of the meal was PLN 73. 
To sum up, if you are very hungry and you haven't found a better pizzeria in the area, go there. However, if you are a very hungry man, you should order two pizzas, and if you are a fat man, three. ;) :) ;)",If you must....,"Katowice, Poland",Katowice,Damian19999,2015-09-06,,,,,,,pos,2015.0,Poland

2,"Generally while traveling in unknown cities, I refer to TripAdvisor reviews to select places to eat. So when I read glowing opinions about La Famiglia, I went there for dinner last night. The outdoor area was full so I sat inside which is fine. Being vegetarian, I ordered the only veggie pizza on the menu with mushrooms and tomatoes as toppings. Well, even at the fairly reasonable price of PLN21, the pizza was hardly worth the wait. In fact, more than the toppings, it wS the crust that was more delicious. Their soup of the day was tomato which I don't much fancy so I avoided it. 
The prices are very reasonable as I said earlier so even having a two or three course meal won't pinch. Service was rather impersonal and it was only at the end that the waitress bothered to ask me if my pizza was fine and gave me the faint impression of a smile. She looked too hassled and overworked according to me. I would not bother going back to La Famiglia if I ever came back to Gdansk.

4,"After travelling all afternoon and upon arrival in Gdansk, i just fancied something straightforward (time for exploring Polish delicacies later) and tasty. A good pizza always works for me, anywhere in the world, so i tracked down this cosy place.
Thin crust pizza is required, no point in paying for dough, and i must say it was indeed thin, as well as tasty. For the only time in my life i ordered - as dessert you might say - a second pizza! This tells you that (a) i was rather hungry (b) the pizzas were gossamer-thin (c) i enjoyed my first one so much i went back for more!
Very fresh base, extremely more-ish and simple but effective topping. For the very reasonable prices charged i don't complain at all if the first one left me wanting more; the perfect excuse to indulge (and yes, the waitress did raise a Polish eyebrow).
Anyway, if you like a tasty pizza La Famiglia should not disappoint. Washed down with an easy house red wine, i can thoroughly recommend them.

The pizza is excellent :) And at an affordable price. The order processing time is very short and the service is efficient and very nice.

I must write one thing with all responsibility - the pizza is delicious!
A big surprise, and a plus, is the ability to choose olive oil for pizza. We chose spicy, herbal and garlic. Great.

3,"We were attracted to this place by the reviews from TripAdvisor, so we went to this pizzeria on Saturday afternoon with two families (8 people). The place is off the beaten track, with little space inside, but fortunately it has a garden across the street. We chose pizza, sandwich and salad. Medium-sized pizzas served on a wooden board with a handle on a piece of parchment, a nice touch, but unfortunately it does not save the pizza. Overall, the pizza seems to want to be Italian, but unfortunately its hard edges made it feel like we were eating a dry piece of bread. The dough lacked freshness and rise. The toppings were perfect, although even though it was an Italian pizza, there were too few of them. Caprese salad: basically what was written was on the plate, additionally sprinkled with balsamic vinegar, tasty, but too simple without any finesse. Overall, tasty, good service, but you can't see the cook's love for what he does. Just so-so pizzas and so-so salads.

He was smiling, gave great advice and we felt as if we had known each other for a long time and not seen each other for the first time. He made this dinner special. Of course, the food was also top notch. Starting from soup with meatballs, which my daughter ate, to steaks and burgers. The burgers are so big that we had no room for dessert. Mr. Szymon surprised my dad with a small birthday gift. It was very nice, thank you again.

Because, the food is really great!  Fantastic wings were spicy but not hot with the BBQ sauce, pork tomahawk was great and that cherry jar drink was yummy.

3,"I had previously visited Wiskey in a Jar some months ago and had a very good impression. I had a memory of a lively place with good ambience and nice food. I decided to visit when I was in Gdansk again. 
It was kind of a strange experience. It must have been a slow night as there were only about 25-30% of the tables occupied inside. Despite of this I was taken upstairs to a kind of balcony overlooking the rest of restaurant. Some tables away was a party with a dog that kept barking loudly at random intervals. A couple of tables away on the other side was a young couple. We were the only guests on the balcony. 
I ordered my food which arrived very fast. It happened when a waiter literally threw the food on my table and with a very loud cry of joy ran to the young couple at the nearby table, where he threw himself on top of the young girl sitting there. She also screamed (understandably) and a lot of commotion followed. They were obviously friends. 
I understood that the balcony is where ""odd"" guests are seated. I resent being treated as ""odd"" just because is am visiting a restaurant sólo.
The food was OK, so that was at least something. But I would prefer if the livelyness is due to happy customers, not barking dogs and loud staff.",Disappointing second visit,"Cadiz, Spain",Cadiz,Buysomething,2023-10-02,,,,,,,pos,2023.0,Foreigner

But thought we'd have another go as we visit Gdansk so regularly.
No queues this time and the server was friendly, but we asked at the 'wait to be seated' sign' if they had paper menus yet.
No. They don't have them and no workaround was offered.
On our holidays we like to enjoy them without carrying our phones around. Maybe not the hip and trendy thing to do, but this is us and many, many more people who come for complete relaxation. The lack of physical menus means that Whiskey in the Jar is a no go area.

The venue was also extremely smoky. It was so gray that you could hardly see the end of the room. 
The smell of smoke and frying settled in all clothes and hair and was so thick that guests started coughing. Here, something seriously needs to be done with fans in the kitchen. It's boring to wear smelly outerwear for several days afterwards.

2,Even though we made a table reservation well in advance of our visit we were kept waiting for a long time along with about ten other customers upon arrival. None of the staff seemed to care about all the waiting customers. After a long while we were finally taken to a table upstairs where we were told to scan a QR code to access the menu. The food menu was offered in English but the drinks menu was available in Polish only. After placing our orders around ten past seven the drinks and starters were delivered shortly after but once we'd finished the starters nothing much happened. We tried to order more drinks while waiting for the main course but were rudely brushed off by a black haired heavily tattooed waitress who clearly didn't feel like interacting with her customers. Only later did she return to our table to take our drinks order. Then nothing happened again until an hour later when the rude waitress returned to inform us that they needed another four minutes before the main course would be ready. At this point in time my wife was ready to leave but about twenty minutes past eight the main course finally arrived. The steak fries along with the corn on the cob and the mushroom sauce were cold and my steak was over cooked given that I'd ordered it rare. Needless to say the visit was a disappointment. All in all the restaurant is a rather sad cliché pretending to be an American style place for poodle rockers and wannabe cool employees who seem to think that as long as they're dressed in all black and covered in tattoos anything goes.

Wrong drink arrived, it was corrected.
Ordered the Tomahawk steak, only the XL available but I’d decided I would like a steak so I ordered the XL.
Wasn’t told at this point that the price shown was for the much cheaper pork tomahawk.
The steak arrived. I had asked for medium. The middle was cold and raw. Seriously? The steak was sent back and came back still raw in the middle! I can only guess the chef brought his kids to work and let them cook.
They offered shots as an apology which I don’t drink. Then charged full price , 3x the price of t advertised “pork “ tomahawk!
Didn’t have the decency to reduce the price of the raw steak which I never finished.
Won’t be back and can only hope the chef returns to cookery school.

5,"Decided for a change of pace away from Eastern European or Polish food. Found whiskey Joe’s. A nice walk from the heart of the old city along the waterfront. Once inside I was amazed at how spacious the restaurant was. Actually has two floors. We sat on the top floor so we could look down and “people watch”. The alcohol selection wasn’t great but sufficient. We ordered the steak that served in a sizzling platter. we made sure to order the steak cooked one level of doneness  below what we really like because it continues to cook on the platter. we ordered the top grade steak and it was worth it. We cooked it to perfection and it was so tender and flavorful. 
The service was a little bit underwhelming but it was prime time and they were very busy. Probably would’ve had a few more drinks if we had better service.

When we ordered, it took around 40 minutes for the food to arrive, and the first two (no idea what it was) were ok+.

2,"My partner and I were very excited to visit this restaurant, it ticked all the boxes! We couldn't wait to try the steaks and the cocktails. Unfortunately, the service is appalling!! I don't normally write reviews but felt like I had too!!! 
We tried to book but we were told to come back and queue (like most restaurants in Gdansk). We were find with this, we were happy just to get a table. We sat inside around 19:00 and noticed that there were quite a few empty tables inside (most people chose to sit outside). We had to wait around 20 mins before we decided to speak to one of the waitresses and we were told that 'Nathalia' would be right with us. Again, we waited another 20 mins (at this point gasping for a drink!) to be told that 'Nathalia' is our waitress and that she'll be right with us. We waited again for a further 10 mins but noticed Nathalia walk by, so we grabbed her and asked if we could order some drinks, she said that she wasn't our waitress but she would take our order anyway!!!!! No apology at this point. 
We had to wait another 20 mins or so for our drinks (at this point I was getting very frustrated and we did nearly leave) but she eventually turned up with some drinks and took our order. We shared the steak platter (and the steak was great!) and asked for onion rings and chips but it came with sweet potato fries and chips!!! So they even got our order wrong too. 
Before the meal we ordered some more drinks (knowing how long these take) but these turned up about half hour after we finished our meal!!!
It was a very frustrating evening. You don't mind waiting a little bit but this was just ridiculous. There was no apology and they got our order wrong. 
We really wanted to try some of the cocktails but we decided to leave. If the service was improved this place could be amazing... such a shame!

My waitress Julia was super awesome and did a great job with making sure food and drinks were timely and followed up with making sure if I wanted another drink (some places don't ask and I prefer when they do, personally). Definitely have to recommend this place! I wasn't going to come until the night of my birthday because they had nice steaks, but ultimately decided to come tonight and the Diablo burger sounded better, and I'm not unhappy about choosing a burger over a steak lol. I feel their steak prices were fair though, especially since they seem to be quite large steaks (9oz for the smaller one for my fellow Americans). Also I've been traveling in Europe for several months and it was nice to feel at home a little here, reminds me of Smoky Mountains Tennessee area but with rock music playing.

All the best.,Szymon the best waiter in Gdańsk.,"Tullow, Ireland",Tullow,Paul33Tullow,2023-07-10,,,,,,,pos,2023.0,Foreigner

4,"The location is fab, the food was decent too. We both had burgers. 
The weather was good enough to sit outside and eat which as a bonus looking into the buildings and water.

When we first arrived two members of staff greeted us friendly explained we could sit anywhere which we did. One member of staff came back and asked us to move so they could link two tables together which we accommodated and our server would be over soon.

The downside we experienced was we waited a while and felt like we were being ignored, the table that sat at originally came in sat down and got served before us, which we didn’t understand. 

The server eventually appeared after we asked for our order to be taken as we had waited patiently.

It then appeared the server was dealing with a large rowdy group of men a few tables away from us and they were getting priority also.

We eat our food asked to pay and left,  I would recommend this place as everything else was fine apart from our experience of being ignored after accommodating a move of table.",Good food- customer service could be better,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Hatrick3,2024-09-28,,,,,,,pos,2024.0,Foreigner

5,"We came Sunday evening and walking in what looked like an American diner, the ribs were delicious,  my husband had a steak that was cooking still on a hot stone where he proceeded to put his finger on it ha ha. He had steak with a side of burnt finger. As its nearing to Halloween they had Michael Myers running around the place causing havoc which to be honest was the highlight of my break. Lovely spooky vibes and top music. Only negative was you accessed the menu online and couldn't really make out as it was in polish but the waitress Isobel sat down and went through it with us, she was lovely and so helpful and i have recommended my sister go there as she's in Gdansk at the moment.  I also had a lovely hot cocktail called cherry choco which was served hot in a mason jar and was delicious.  Bit pricier compared to other polish restaurants but then it was more fun than other restaurants i suppose and still cheaper than the UK.
